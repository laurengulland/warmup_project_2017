# Turning in your Work
See info at: https://sites.google.com/site/comprobo17/projects/warmup-project

## Code: 
your code should be pushed to your Github repository. All code should be placed within a ROS package called warmup_project.

## Writeup: 
in your ROS package create a file to hold your project writeup. Any format is fine (markdown, word, pdf, etc.). Your writeup should answer the following questions.  I expect this writeup to be done in such a way that you are proud to include it as part of your professional portfolio.  As such, please make sure to write the report so that it is understandable to an external audience.  Consider adding pictures to your report, or links to youtube videos of your robot programs in action.  You have no idea how persuasive a project like this can be to a prospective employer!
- For each behavior, describe the problem at a high-level.  Include any relevant diagrams that help explain your approach.  Discuss your strategy at a high-level and include any tricky decisions that had to be made to realize a successful implementation.
- For the finite state controller, what was the overall behavior.  What were the states? What did the robot do in each state? How did you combine and how did you detect when to transition between behaviors?  Consider including a state transition diagram in your writeup.
- How was your code structured?  Make sure to include a sufficient detail about the object-oriented structure you used for your project.
- What if any challenges did you face along the way? 
- What would you do to improve your project if you had more time? 
- What are the key takeaways from this assignment for future robotic programming projects?
