#Project Overview
This was a two-person "warmup project" for the Introduction to Computational Robotics Class at Olin College of Engineering, taught by [Paul Ruvolo](https://github.com/paulruvolo) in Spring 2017. The project was aimed to be an introduction to using ROS for mobile robotics, processing data from sensors, programming robot behaviors using reactive control strategies, and using finite-state control. 

To meet these learning goals, we were expected to use Python scripts and ROS to:
* Use RViz for visualization and debugging: 
  * Visualize incoming sensor data
  * Create markers to visualize important points in code (e.g. a representation of the point the robot is following)
  * replay rosbag data 
* Create a teleoperation mode for the robot
* Make the robot drive in a 1 meter by 1 meter square
* Drive until it encounters a wall, at which point it turns to follow it (parallel to the wall)
* Dynamically follow a person or other object
* Avoid obstacles
* Combining multiple behaviors using finite-state control
